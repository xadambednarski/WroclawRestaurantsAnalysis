# Wroclaw Restaurants Analysis
## Introduction
The project aims to carry out an analysis of the network of restaurants located in Wroclaw. In addition a quick simulation was made
to emerge a few top restaurants that will potentially still prosper within the next 5 years.
## Technologies
The project was fully implemented in Python, using the following libraries:

1. BeautifulSoup for webscraping data (UberEats website)
2. Pyvis, networkx and matplotlib for visualizing data
3. Numpy, random, collections, json, requests for simulation

## Navigation
To run network visualisation in a more complex, enhanced view run main.py script.
To run network simulation along with getting some major statistics run simulation.py script.
